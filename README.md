When I wanted to play some Age of Empires II on my laptop with a 4k resolution screen, I ran into various problems. So I ended up writing a small program to automatically bring the game window in a certain position and then magnify the visible screen to this part of the screen. Then I decided to upload my program, as other people seemed to have the same problem, yet there was no solution working for everyone.

Over time, I changed small things as users reported problems, but I have to stress that this is not a professional tool. In fact, the whole idea is already extremely hacky and the implementation uses some magic numbers as input, since I was not able to read out and/or calculate the correct numbers over the provided programmer's interface from MS Windows. And even if it works, it's not quite the same experience as you could have if the game supported to adjust the resolution in game.

Note that the tool works on arbitrary windows and is not limited to Age of Empires II only, just adjust the window name to your application of choice.

See the Steam site for a long description of the problem and how to use this tool: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=551837588
